    A[User Image Input] --> B[MCP Protocol]
    B --> C[ML Service]
    C --> D[Clothing Analysis Service]
    D --> E[Feature Extraction]
    E --> F[Garment Recognition]
    F --> G[Attribute Detection]
    G --> H[Style Analysis]

    I --> J[Visualization Components]
```

### Data Flow

1. **Image Capture**: User captures outfit image via camera
2. **MCP Processing**: Request routed through Model Context Protocol
3. **Feature Extraction**: Deep CNN extracts visual features
4. **Garment Recognition**: Instance segmentation identifies individual clothing items
5. **Attribute Detection**: Multi-head attention network identifies colors, patterns, materials
6. **Style Analysis**: Context-aware model evaluates occasion match and style coherence
7. **Recommendation Generation**: Style suggestions based on analysis results
8. **Results Visualization**: Scores, metrics, and recommendations displayed to user

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a custom communication layer between the UI and backend ML processing logic, providing a unified interface for all ML operations.

        B --> C[MCP Protocol]
    end

        C --> E[clothing-analysis-service.ts]
        C --> F[fs-utils.ts]
        D --> G[ML Models]
        E --> G

        F --> H[Analysis Data]
        F --> I[Image Storage]
        F --> J[Feedback Data]
    end
```

### MCP Operations

The MCP supports the following operations:

1. **INIT_STORAGE**: Initialize data directories and storage
2. **ANALYZE_OUTFIT**: Basic outfit analysis
3. **ANALYZE_OUTFIT_DETAILS**: Detailed garment and style analysis
4. **MATCH_OCCASION**: Match outfit to specific occasions
5. **GET_STYLE_SUGGESTIONS**: Generate style improvement suggestions
6. **SAVE_ANALYSIS**: Store analysis results
7. **GET_ANALYSIS**: Retrieve stored analysis
8. **LIST_ANALYSES**: List all stored analyses
9. **DELETE_ANALYSIS**: Remove a specific analysis
10. **CLEAR_ANALYSES**: Clear all stored analyses
11. **RECORD_FEEDBACK**: Save user feedback
12. **GET_FEEDBACK**: Retrieve user feedback
13. **REMOVE_FEEDBACK**: Delete specific feedback
14. **CLEAR_FEEDBACK**: Clear all feedback

## Machine Learning Techniques

## Implementation Details

### Visibility Optimization

The application implements smart resource management through visibility tracking:

```javascript
// When tab is visible, perform detailed analysis
if (isTabVisible) {
  const analysisResult = await executeMCPOperation({
    type: "ANALYZE_OUTFIT_DETAILS",
    imageData: imageData,
  });
  setDetailedAnalysis(analysisResult.result);
} else {
  // Defer processing when tab is hidden
  console.log("Deferring detailed analysis, tab not visible");
}
```

### Progressive Enhancement

The system uses a progressive enhancement approach:

1. **Basic Analysis**: Initial garment detection and scoring (lightweight)
2. **Detailed Analysis**: In-depth attribute recognition on demand (resource-intensive)
3. **Style Suggestions**: Generated recommendations based on analysis results

### Feedback Loop

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Captures Image] --> B[Basic Analysis]
    B --> C[User Views Results]
    C --> D[User Provides Feedback]
    D --> E[Feedback Data Storage]
    E --> F[Model Improvement Pipeline]
    F --> G[Updated Models]
    G --> B
```

The application captures user feedback to continuously improve the ML models:

- **Upvoting/Downvoting**: User ratings on analysis accuracy
- **Style Preferences**: Learning user style preferences over time
- **Error Analysis**: Identifying common failure modes for targeted improvements
